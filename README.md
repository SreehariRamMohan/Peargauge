üçê Peargauge // Making virtual lectures interactive. 

### Demo link: https://peargauge-dev.herokuapp.com

In virtual lectures, it can be difficult for teachers to effectively gauge student understanding. 

Peargauge allows instructors to administer realtime questions during a lecture or recitation session. 

A few notable features
* Create, edit, download question decks (with LaTeX formatting)
* Quick to join sessions, students can join by scanning a QR code with their phone and answer questions anonymously.
* Instructors can have full control over the duration of each question, no more annoying time limits (you choose when to advance).

### Building from source
If you would like to build Peargauge locally, you will need to set up Redis, and MongoDB locally. 

1. Clone this repository. 
2. Run ```npm install``` in the root directory
3. ```cd backend``` and create a python virtual environment ```python3 -m venv ./venv```
4. Activate the environment ```source activate venv``` and pip install the requirements.txt file ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
5. Create a ```.flaskenv``` file in backend and set appropriate values for the following environment variables:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=server.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
export APPLICATION_MODE=local
export MONGO_URI=<MongoDB URI>
```

5. Run the flask server with ```python server.py```
6. Run the front end with ```npm start```
